## Categories Reference

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Security** | OWASP vulnerabilities, authentication/authorization issues, data exposure |
| **Resiliency** | Single points of failure, missing timeouts, lack of graceful degradation |
| **Architecture** | Contradictions with ADRs, unclear integration points, scalability concerns |
| **Performance** | Potential bottlenecks, missing caching, inefficient algorithms |
| **Clarity** | Ambiguous requirements, missing specifications, conflicting documentation |

## Severity Levels

| Level | Response Time | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Immediate | Blocks implementation or introduces serious risk |
| **High** | Within sprint | Significant issue that needs resolution soon |
| **Medium** | Planned | Should be addressed but not blocking |
| **Low** | Backlog | Minor concern or improvement suggestion |

## Escalation Path

For findings requiring architectural decisions:
1. Document finding in this file
2. Notify {{escalation_contact}}
3. Schedule review with Solution Architect if needed
4. Do NOT proceed with conflicting assumptions
